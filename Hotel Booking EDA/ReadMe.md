# Hotel Booking Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves an exploratory data analysis of a dataset containing booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel. The analysis aims to uncover insights that can help in understanding the best times to book a hotel, optimal stay durations, and predict patterns such as the likelihood of special requests from guests.

## Data Description
The dataset includes various details about hotel bookings, stripped of any personally identifying information, and covers the following key aspects:
- **Hotel Type**: Whether the booking is for a city hotel or a resort hotel.
- **Booking Cancellation**: Indicates if a booking was cancelled.
- **Lead Time**: Number of days between the booking and the arrival.
- **Stay Duration**: Information on the number of weekend and weekday nights booked.
- **Guest Information**: Data on the number of adults, children, and babies per booking.
- **Booking Details**: Information on meal type, the country of origin of the guests, market segment, and booking medium.

## Insights from Analysis
- Patterns of bookings in terms of timing and length of stay.
- Preferences of guests based on their country of origin and chosen hotel type.
- Trends in booking cancellations and special requests.

## Tools Used
The analysis is conducted using Python, with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization.

## Conclusion
The insights derived from this analysis can be leveraged by hotel management to optimize their booking strategies, improve guest satisfaction, and potentially increase revenue.
